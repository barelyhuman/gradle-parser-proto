# gradle-parser-proto

# THIS IS A PROTOTYPE REPOSITORY AND WILL NEVER BE A PACKAGE

This is a hacky attempt at a gradle file parser which will be implemented to be used with [barelyhuman/mobile-version-sync](https://github.com/barelyhuman/mobile-version-sync) in a different language altogether, this repository only exists as a reference and a potential backup of the logic.
